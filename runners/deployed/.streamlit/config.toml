#   "Nunito:https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito&display=swap")
# - A comma-separated list of these (as a single string) to specify
#   fallbacks
#
# For example, you can use the following:
#
# font = "cool-font, fallback-cool-font, sans-serif"
# font =

# An array of fonts to use in your app.
#
# Each font in the array is a table (dictionary) that can have the
# following attributes, closely resembling CSS font-face definitions:
# - family
# - url
# - weight (optional)
# - style (optional)
# - unicodeRange (optional)
#
# To host a font with your app, enable static file serving with
# `server.enableStaticServing=true`.
#
# You can define multiple [[theme.fontFaces]] tables, including multiple
# tables with the same family if your font is defined by multiple files.
#
# For example, a font hosted with your app may have a [[theme.fontFaces]]
# table as follows:
#
# [[theme.fontFaces]]
# family = "font_name"
# url = "app/static/font_file.woff"
# weight = "400"
# style = "normal"
# fontFaces =

# The root font size (in pixels) for the app.

# If this isn't set, Streamlit uses `theme.font` for headings.
# headingFont =

# One or more font sizes for h1-h6 headings.
#
# If no sizes are set, Streamlit will use the default sizes for h1-h6
# headings. Heading font sizes set in [theme] are not inherited by
# [theme.sidebar]. The following sizes are used by default:
# [
#     "2.75rem", # h1 (1.5rem for sidebar)
#     "2.25rem", # h2 (1.25rem for sidebar)
#     "1.75rem", # h3 (1.125rem for sidebar)

#     "1.25rem", # h5 (0.875rem for sidebar)
#     "1rem", # h6 (0.75rem for sidebar)
# ]
#
# If you specify an array with fewer than six sizes, the unspecified
# heading sizes will be the default values. For example, you can use the
# following array to set the font sizes for h1-h3 headings while keeping
# h4-h6 headings at their default sizes:
# headingFontSizes = ["3rem", "2.875rem", "2.75rem"]
#
# Setting a single value (not in an array) will set the font size for all
# h1-h6 headings to that value:
# headingFontSizes = "2.75rem"
#
# Font sizes can be specified in pixels or rem, but rem is recommended.
# headingFontSizes =

# One or more font weights for h1-h6 headings.
#
# If no weights are set, Streamlit will use the default weights for h1-h6
# headings. Heading font weights set in [theme] are not inherited by
# [theme.sidebar]. The following weights are used by default:
# [
#     700, # h1 (bold)
#     600, # h2 (semi-bold)
#     600, # h3 (semi-bold)
#     600, # h4 (semi-bold)
#     600, # h5 (semi-bold)
#     600, # h6 (semi-bold)
# ]
#
# If you specify an array with fewer than six weights, the unspecified
# heading weights will be the default values. For example, you can use
# the following array to set the font weights for h1-h2 headings while
# keeping h3-h6 headings at their default weights:
# headingFontWeights = [800, 700]
#
# Setting a single value (not in an array) will set the font weight for
# all h1-h6 headings to that value:
# headingFontWeights = 500
# headingFontWeights =

# The font family to use for code (monospace) in the sidebar.
#
# This can be one of the following:
# - "sans-serif"
# - "serif"
# - "monospace"
# - The `family` value for a custom font table under [[theme.fontFaces]]
# - A URL to a CSS file in the format of "<font name>:<url>" (like

# This can be one of the following:

# If no sizes are set, Streamlit will use the default sizes for h1-h6
# headings. Heading font sizes set in [theme] are not inherited by
# [theme.sidebar]. The following sizes are used by default:
# [
#     "2.75rem", # h1 (1.5rem for sidebar)

# One or more font weights for h1-h6 headings.

# If no weights are set, Streamlit will use the default weights for h1-h6

# If you specify an array with fewer than six weights, the unspecified

# keeping h3-h6 headings at their default weights:
# headingFontWeights = [800, 700]
#
# Setting a single value (not in an array) will set the font weight for

# headingFontWeights = 500

# codeFontSize =

# The font weight for code blocks and code text.

# For example, you can use "10px", "0.5rem", or "2rem". To follow best

# The background color of the dataframe's header.
#
# This color applies to all non-interior cells of the dataframe. This
